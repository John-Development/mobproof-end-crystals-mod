# Mob proof end crystals


This mod is a vanillaish version of the mod torchmaster.

 

It allows to spawnproof areas of 64x64x64 blocks with just one end crystal (cubic, not spherical).

The area starts from the crystal to 64 blocks above vertically and 32 blocks in each horizontal direction (north, east, south, west). This is mainly because it is easier to hide it below the surface you want to spawnproof.

 

 

 

The original idea of this concept is made by [ethnographie](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ethnographie/) and you cand find her datapack [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/mob-proof-crystals/).
